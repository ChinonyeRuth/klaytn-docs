2022 was a banner year for Klaytn, and we have a lot to be proud of! From tech upgrades to ecosystem growth, we’ve made significant strides in advancing our vision of the metaverse:

1. Technology Advancements

🏆 With V 1.8.0 introduced in March this year, Klaytn is now Ethereum-equivalent, so developers can easily use our EVM-equivalent tools and interfaces.

🏆 User experience is key in the metaverse, so we’ve kept our average transaction latency low at 2.13 seconds (one of the lowest among L1 blockchains).

🏆 We introduced a dynamic gas price policy to ensure our network remains stable and fast while preventing network abuse.

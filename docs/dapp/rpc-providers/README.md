## BlockPi

BlockPI Network aims to provide high-quality, robust, and efficient RPC service. To avoid the single-point failure and limitation of scalability, the network is designed to be a distributed structure with expandable working nodes. 

**Note**: BlockPi uses Request Units (RUs) to transparently measure usage. The RPC methods are charged based on the data size. The rate is 5 RUs per 250 byte. The rate is 50000 RUs per $0.01. You can see the number of request units for each plan [here](https://docs.blockpi.io/documentations/pricing) and the individual method cost for Klaytn [here](https://docs.blockpi.io/documentations/request-unit-ru#individual-method-cost).

### Features

- 20 requests per second on the free plan, and unlimited for paid plans (Elementary, Premium and Enterprise).
- No hard limit for Klaytn archive node and endpoint node
- Whitelisting possible for endpoint nodes
- WSS connections currently under development.

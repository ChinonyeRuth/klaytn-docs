# Before You Start

**Klaytn Networks**

* Baobab testnet
* Cypress mainnet

**Endpoint Node**

* Your [Endpoint Node](../../nodes/endpoint-node/endpoint-node.md) is needed to connect to the Klaytn network and to issue an API call or send a transaction.
* `ken` is a Klaytn Endpoint Node binary. `ken` exposes two interfaces, a [command-line interface](../../nodes/endpoint-node/ken-cli-commands.md) and the [JSON-RPC APIs](../../../references/json-rpc/klay/account-created). `ken` runs on Linux and MacOS.
* `ken` CLI comes with several utility and node management functions.

**Smart Contract Development**

* [Klaytn Plugin for Remix](https://ide.klaytn.foundation) - Klaytn Plugin for Remix, a browser-based compiler and IDE.
* [Truffle](https://github.com/trufflesuite/truffle) - An open-source tool for developing smart contracts in Solidity.
* [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/hardhat-runner/docs/getting-started) - A development environment for smart contracts and dApps.
* [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) - Foundry is a smart contract development toolchain.
* [Thirdweb](https://portal.thirdweb.com/) - Thirdweb is a complete web3 development framework that provides services to build, manage, and analyze web3 applications.

**Klaytn SDKs**

* [caver-js](../../references/sdk/caver-js/caver-js.md) : A JavaScript library that implements the Klaytn JSON-RPC APIs.
* [caver-java](../../references/sdk/caver-java/caver-java.md) : A Java library that implements the Klaytn JSON-RPC APIs.

**Klaytn Toolkits**

* [Klaytnscope](https://klaytnscope.com/) - A block and transaction explorer.
* [Klaytn Wallet](https://wallet.klaytn.com/) - A browser-based account management tool.
* [Klaytn Contracts Wizard](https://wizard.klaytn.foundation/) - An interactive generator to bootstrap your smart contract and learn about Klaytn Contracts.


**Glossary**
This glossary defines terms you may encounter throughout this documentation.

* dApp (Decentralized Application): An application that runs on a decentralized network like blockchain,  independent of a single server controlled by a company. dApps are potentially more secure, transparent, and resistant to censorship.

* JSON-RPC APIs:  A communication method that uses JSON (a data format) to send requests and receive responses. It allows developer tools and applications to interact with the Klaytn network, read data, or send transactions.  Imagine JSON-RPC APIs as a remote control with buttons for specific actions on the Klaytn network (the machine).

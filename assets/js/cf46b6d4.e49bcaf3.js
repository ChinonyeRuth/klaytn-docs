VRFs are essential to many blockchain applications, as having access to tamper-proof randomization enables exciting blockchain games, rare NFTs, and efficient unbiased outcomes.\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\nIn this article, you will create a subscription, add a consumer contract programmatically and get random values using Chainlink VRF v2 on the Klaytn Blockchain.\\n\\nWhy VRFs\\nBefore VRFs, getting random numbers on-chain was a major problem and has played a part in major protocol exploits. The following are the malicious or risky traditional random number generators (RNG) methods previously used and their shortcomings:\\n\\nUsing block variables\\n\\nUsing block variables such as block.number, block.timestamp, or block.difficulty to simulate randomness is risky as it can be predicted to some degree."},{"id":"/2023/01/01/hello-klaytn1","metadata":{"permalink":"/klaytn-docs/blog/2023/01/01/hello-klaytn1","source":"@site/blog/2023-01-01-hello-klaytn1.md","title":"Klaytn SDK caver-js/java v1.10.0 Release","description":"This is the test1 description","date":"2023-01-01T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"January 1, 2023","tags":[{"label":"klaytn","permalink":"/klaytn-docs/blog/tags/klaytn"},{"label":"sdk","permalink":"/klaytn-docs/blog/tags/sdk"},{"label":"release","permalink":"/klaytn-docs/blog/tags/release"}],"readingTime":0.67,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Klaytn Knight","title":"Media Team","url":"https://klaytn.foundation/contact-us/","image_url":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4256.png","email":"media@klaytn.foundation","imageURL":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4256.png"}],"frontMatter":{"title":"Klaytn SDK caver-js/java v1.10.0 Release","description":"This is the test1 description","authors":{"name":"Klaytn Knight","title":"Media Team","url":"https://klaytn.foundation/contact-us/","image_url":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4256.png","email":"media@klaytn.foundation","imageURL":"https://s2.coinmarketcap.com/static/img/coins/64x64/4256.png"},"tags":["klaytn","sdk","release"]},"prevItem":{"title":"How to use oracles on Klaytn \u2014 VRF\u2019s Explained","permalink":"/klaytn-docs/blog/2023/01/02/hello-klaytn2"}},"content":"![text for image](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*Zol0ss3r_1Fwt0G1.webp)\\n\\n# [Notice] Klaytn SDK caver-js v1.10.0 Release\\n\\nWith the release of Klaytn v1.10.0, some changes have been applied to caver-js.
